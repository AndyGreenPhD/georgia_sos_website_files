See the article at https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/georgia-secretary-of-state-brian-kemp-doxes-thousands-absentee-voters/ for some background.

File was originally available on the SoS website until sometime during the day on Wedneday, 11.7.2018.  The file was taken offline, but made available again at some point after this article was published.  I downloaded during the afternoon of Thursday, 11.8.2018.  I compared the file size of the SoS file against an archive copy at https://web.archive.org/web/20181107211356/http://sos.ga.gov/admin/uploads/Absentee%20Ballot%20Status%20File.xlsx and they match.

NOTE: Files with identical filenames and a numeric extension are a single file that were split into fragments using 7-Zip, for storage on Github.
